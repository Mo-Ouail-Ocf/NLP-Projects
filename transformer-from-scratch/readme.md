- In this repo , I built transformer from scratch in Pytorch
- I trained the transformer on translation task from english to french using **[opus dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Helsinki-NLP/opus_books)**.
- The architecture , code organisation and most of logic was inspired by Mr's Umar Jamil code and youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISNdQcPhsts&t=7047s)
- I highly recommned to check Mr's Umar Jamil channel , very high class ressource to understand & implement research papers
